hype: So I can have something to look at whilst I build this thing ;-)
---

I've had this blog on my mind for a while -- been umming and ahing about what
platform to build it on, which hosting to go with -- anything but actually build the thing and start writing!

So either I never get around to it, or I just start writing and find the limitations
that need fixing as a go along.

I'm probably going to write about technology, and pet projects.

```js
console.log('Hello world');
```
