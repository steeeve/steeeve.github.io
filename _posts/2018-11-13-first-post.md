hype: So I can have something to look at whilst I build this thing ;-)
---

I've had this blog on my mind for a while -- have been umming and ahing about what
platform to build it on, which hosting to go with... anything but actually build the thing and start writing!

Either I never get around to it, or instead I just start writing and find the limitations that need fixing as I go along.

I'm probably going to write about technology, and pet projects, life in general.
Nothing *too* personal in this day and age. Enjoy!

```js
console.log('Hello world');
```
