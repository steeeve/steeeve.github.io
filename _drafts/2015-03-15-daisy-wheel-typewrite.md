title: Daisy wheel typewriter
hype: This is a project to build an electronic typewriter with a USB keyboard input so that I can use my 60% mechanical keyboard with it.

The rough plan is to build a printing unit with an old daisy-wheel,
some motors and an ATMega board. That unit will take instructions over
TTY from a Raspberry Pi to act as the brains.

In the future the project might be extended to include: an email
client (think fax); A REPL on paper.
