hype: Attempting to match Hey.com features with a regular email account
---

Signed up to hey.com when they made it public access - it's nice! Love the UI,
and the way it simplifies your inbox.

The price seems high, but can you put a price on yourself as the product? Well
alternative email is closer to £25 - £50, so maybe that is the price? And
then the rest £75-£25 is for the novel features... So I was wondering if I could
match those features with another account? No imap? hhmm so it's non-interoprable
- I guess because of those great features!

From what I can tell, yes, and pretty easily - using filters!

## Rule 1 - verification

Anyone I haven't authorised to email me goes into a holding pen until I give
them the okay.

Rule:

```
NOT in "Allow" contacts group  # This will also cover email addresses not in contacts at all
```
- Add label 'unverified'
- Remove from inbox

## Rule 1b

Anyone in the deny list goes straight to spam. Rule 1 gives us a chance
to unsubscribe anyway - but just in case we can also save the contact to the
'deny' contact group.

Rule:
```
in "Deny" contacts group
```
- Mark as read
- Send to spam (or delete?)

## Rule 2

Any newsletters go into "the feed". Any well behaved newsletters should have
proper unsubcribe headers, and ones that don't will probably end up in spam
anyway! Also we can look for the word 'unsubscibe' in the body just in case.

Rule:
```
header:List-Unsubscribe
body:unsubscribe // optional
```
- Remove from inbox
- Add label 'The Feed'

## 'Rule' 3
