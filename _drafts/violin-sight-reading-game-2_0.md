When I built the first version of this tool I was exploring game programming
with [PIXI.js](http://www.pixijs.com/). Throughout that process it never really
felt like a good fit for what could have been a very simple MVC-like project.

I decided to do a rebuild in [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) as a learning exercise.

The result is conceptually a lot simpler, as well as looking nicer! The code
could maybe use a bit of refactoring, and there are no tests (I was learning
how to structure things as I went) - but overall I'm exceptionally happy
with the results.

It also only took a couple of evenings of painfree development. Which could
be testament to the react/redux way of working, or just a good fit for
this project.

Enjoy learning with it!:
